       The sseerr22nneett daemon allows telnet and tcp  sessions  to  be  established
       with a unit's serial ports.

       The  program  comes up normally as a daemon, opens the TCP ports speci-
       fied in the configuration file, and waits for connections.  Once a con-
       nection  occurs, the program attempts to set up the connection and open
       the serial port.  If another user is already using  the  connection  or
       serial port, the connection is refused with an error message.

              Handle a single configuration line.  This may be specified  mul-
              tiple times for multiple lines.  This is just like a line in the
              config file.  This disables the default config  file,  you  must
              specify  a  -c  after the last -C to have it read a config file,
              too.

       _-_n     Stops  the  daemon  from  forking  and  detaching  from the con-

       _-_d     Like -n, but also sends the system logs to standard output. This
              is most useful for debugging purposes.

              is not created by default, you must specify this to create  one.
              Note  also  that  this  filename  must be specific with the full

              Enables  the control port and sets the TCP port to listen to for
              the control port.  A port number may be of the form [host,]port,
              such as 127.0.0.1,2000 or localhost,2000.  If this is specified,
              it will only bind to the IP  address  specified  for  the  port.
              Otherwise, it will bind to all the addresses on the machine.

              If the port number is zero, that means that standard in/out will
              be used for the only input/output, and only one port  should  be
              specified in the config.  This way, it can be used from inetd.

       The  control port provides a simple interface for controlling the ports
       and viewing their status. To accomplish this, it has the following com-
       mands:

       sshhoowwppoorrtt [[<<TTCCPP ppoorrtt>>]]
              Show  information  about  a port. If no port is given, all ports
              are displayed.

       sshhoowwsshhoorrttppoorrtt [[<<TTCCPP ppoorrtt>>]]
              Show information about a port, each port on one line. If no port
              is  given,  all ports are displayed.  This can produce very wide
              output.

       hheellpp   Display a short list and summary of commands.

       eexxiitt   Disconnect from the control port.

       vveerrssiioonn
              Display the version of this program.

       mmoonniittoorr <<ttyyppee>> <<ttccpp ppoorrtt>>
              Display all the input for a given port on  the  calling  control
              port.   Only one direction may be monitored at a time.  The type
              field may be _t_c_p or _t_e_r_m and specifies whether to  monitor  data
              from  the  TCP port or from the serial port Note that data moni-
              toring is best effort, if the controller port cannot keep up the
              data  will  be  silently dropped.  A controller may only monitor
              one thing and a port may only be monitored by one controller.

       mmoonniittoorr ssttoopp
              Stop the current monitor.

       ddiissccoonnnneecctt <<ttccpp ppoorrtt>>

              Set the amount of time in seconds  before  the  port  connection
              will be shut down if no activity has been seen on the port.

       sseettppoorrttccoonnffiigg <<ttccpp ppoorrtt>> <<ccoonnffiigg>>

              //eettcc//sseerr22nneett..ccoonnff file.  If conflicting options  are  specified,
              the  last option will be the one used.  Note that these will not
              change until the  port  is  disconnected  and  connected  again.
              Options _3_0_0_, _1_2_0_0_, _2_4_0_0_, _4_8_0_0_, _9_6_0_0_, _1_9_2_0_0_, _3_8_4_0_0_, _5_7_6_0_0_, _1_1_5_2_0_0
              set the various baud rates.  _E_V_E_N_, _O_D_D_,  _N_O_N_E  set  the  parity.

              Sets  the  port  operation state.  Valid states are: _o_f_f to shut
              the TCP port down, _r_a_w to enable the TCP port transfer  all  I/O
              as-is,  _r_a_w_l_p  to  enable  the  TCP port input and device output

   FFIIEELLDDSS
       _T_C_P _p_o_r_t
              Name  or number of the TCP/IP port to  accept  connections  from
              for  this device.  A port number may be of the form [host,]port,
              such as 127.0.0.1,2000 or localhost,2000.  If this is specified,
              it  will  only  bind  to  the IP address specified for the port.
              Otherwise, it will bind to all the ports on the machine.

       _s_t_a_t_e  Either rraaww or rraawwllpp or tteellnneett or ooffff..   _o_f_f  disables  the  port
              from  accepting connections.  It can be turned on later from the
              control port.  _r_a_w enables the port and transfers all data as-is
              between  the  port  and  the  long.   _r_a_w_l_p enables the port and
              transfers all input data to device, device is open  without  any
              termios  setting.  It allow to use /dev/lpX devices and printers
              connected to them.  _t_e_l_n_e_t enables the port and runs the  telnet
              protocol  on the port to set up telnet parameters.  This is most
              useful for using telnet.

       _t_i_m_e_o_u_t
              The time (in seconds) before the port will  be  disconnected  if
              there  is  no activity on it.  A zero value disables this funci-
              ton.

       _d_e_v_i_c_e The  name  of  the  device  to connect to. This must be  in  the

              options of a port.

       _t_r_a_c_e_f_i_l_e
              The file to send the trace into.  Note that  this  takes  escape

       Filenames and banners may contain normal "C" escape sequences:

         \a - bell
         \b - backspace
         \f - form feed
         \n - newline
         \r - carraige return
         \t - tab
         \v - vertical tab
         \\ - \
         \? - ?
         \' - '
         \" - "
         \nnn - octal value for nnn
         \xXX - hex value for XX

       They may also contain, \d for the device name and \p for the  TCP  port
       number.

       A  banner may contain \s for the serial port parameters (eg 9600N81) of
       the given connection.

       A filename may also contain the following sequences:

         \Y -> year
         \y -> day of the year (days since Jan 1)
         \M -> month (Jan, Feb, Mar, etc.)
         \m -> month (as a number)
         \A -> day of the week (Mon, Tue, etc.)
         \D -> day of the month
         \e -> epoc (seconds since Jan 1, 1970)
         \U -> microseconds in the current second
         \p -> local port number
         \d -> local device name
         \I -> remote IP address (in dot format)
         \H -> hour (24-hour time)
         \h -> hour (12-hour time)
         \i -> minute
         \s -> second
         \q -> am/pm
         \P -> AM/PM

       These sequences may be used to make the filename unique  per  open  and
       identify  which  port/device  the filename was for.  Note that in file-
       names when using \d, everything up to  and  including  last  /  in  the
       device  name  is removed, because you can't have a / in a filename.  So
       in a filename /dev/ttyS0 would become just ttyS0.

       ser2net uses the tcp wrappers interface to implement  host-based  secu-
       rity.   See  hosts_access(5)  for a description of the file setup.  Two
       daemons are used by ser2net,  "ser2net"  is  for  the  data  ports  and
       "ser2net-control" is for the control ports.

            If ser2net receives a SIGHUP, it will reread it configuration file
            and make the appropriate changes.  If an inuse port is changed  or
            deleted,  the  actual change will not occur until the port is dis-
            connected.
